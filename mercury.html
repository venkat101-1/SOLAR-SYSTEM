                    <td><b>Mercury</b> is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. In English, it is named after 
                        the ancient Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, and the messenger of the gods. 
                        Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. The surface of Mercury 
                        is heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact events that have accumulated over billions of years. Its largest 
                        crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi) and one-third the diameter of the planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi). 
                        Similarly to the Earth's Moon, Mercury's surface displays an expansive rupes system generated from thrust faults and bright ray 
                        systems formed by impact event remnants.<BR><BR>

                        Mercury's sidereal year (88.0 Earth days) and sidereal day (58.65 Earth days) are in a 3:2 ratio. This relationship is called spin–orbit resonance, 
                        and sidereal here means "relative to the stars". Consequently, one solar day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts for around 176 Earth days: twice 
                        the planet's sidereal year. This means that one side of Mercury will remain in sunlight for one Mercurian year of 88 Earth days; while during the next orbit,
                        that side will be in darkness all the time until the next sunrise after another 88 Earth days.<BR><BR>
                        

                        As of the early 2020s, many broad details of Mercury's geological history are still under investigation or pending data from space probes. Like other planets 
                        in the Solar System, Mercury was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago. Its mantle is highly homogeneous, which suggests that Mercury had a magma ocean 
                        early in its history, like the Moon. According to current models, Mercury may have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid outer core, a deeper 
                        liquid core layer, and a solid inner core.

                        The earliest known recorded observations of Mercury are from the MUL.APIN tablets. These observations were most likely
                        made by an Assyrian astronomer around the 14th century BC. The cuneiform name used to designate Mercury on the MUL.APIN 
                        tablets is transcribed as UDU.IDIM.GU\U4.UD (<B><Q>the jumping planet</Q></B>). Babylonian records of Mercury date back to the 1st millennium BC.
                        The Babylonians called the planet Nabu after the messenger to the gods in their mythology.<BR><BR>

                        The Greco-Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy wrote about the possibility of planetary transits across the face of the Sun in his work Planetary Hypotheses. 
                        He suggested that no transits had been observed either because planets such as Mercury were too small to see, or because transits were too infrequent.
                        In ancient China, Mercury was known as "the Hour Star" (Chen-xing 辰星). It was associated with the direction north and the phase of water in the Five 
                        Phases system of metaphysics. Modern Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese cultures refer to the planet literally as the "water star" (水星), based 
                        on the Five elements. Hindu mythology used the name Budha for Mercury, and this god was thought to preside over Wednesday. The god Odin (or Woden) of 
                        Germanic paganism was associated with the planet Mercury and Wednesday. The Maya may have represented Mercury as an owl (or possibly four owls; two for
                        the morning aspect and two for the evening) that served as a messenger to the underworld.<BR><BR>

                        Mercury has the most eccentric orbit of all the planets in the Solar System; its eccentricity is 0.21 with its distance
                        from the Sun ranging from 46,000,000 to 70,000,000 km (29,000,000 to 43,000,000 mi). It takes 87.969 Earth days to complete
                        an orbit. The diagram illustrates the effects of the eccentricity, showing Mercury's orbit overlaid with a circular orbit 
                        having the same semi-major axis. Mercury's higher velocity when it is near perihelion is clear from the greater distance it 
                        covers in each 5-day interval. In the diagram, the varying distance of Mercury to the Sun is represented by the size of the planet, 
                        which is inversely proportional to Mercury's distance from the Sun.<BR><BR>
                        
                        This varying distance to the Sun leads to Mercury's surface being flexed by tidal bulges raised by the Sun that are about 17 times 
                        stronger than the Moon's on Earth. Combined with a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance of the planet's rotation around its axis, it also results 
                        in complex variations of the surface temperature. The resonance makes a single solar day (the length between two meridian transits of the Sun) 
                        on Mercury last exactly two Mercury years, or about 176 Earth days.<BR><BR>
                        
                        Mercury's orbit is inclined by 7 degrees to the plane of Earth's orbit (the ecliptic), the largest of all eight known solar planets.
                        As a result, transits of Mercury across the face of the Sun can only occur when the planet is crossing the plane of the ecliptic at 
                        the time it lies between Earth and the Sun, which is in May or November. This occurs about every seven years on average.<BR><BR>

                        Mercury's axial tilt is almost zero, with the best measured value as low as 0.027 degrees.This is significantly smaller than
                        that of Jupiter, which has the second smallest axial tilt of all planets at 3.1 degrees. This means that to an observer at Mercury's 
                        poles, the center of the Sun never rises more than 2.1 arcminutes above the horizon. By comparison, the angular size of the Sun as seen 
                        from Mercury ranges from 1+1⁄4 to 2 degrees across.
