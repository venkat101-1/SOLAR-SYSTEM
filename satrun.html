                    <td><b>Saturn</b> is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant, with an average radius of about
                        nine times that of Earth. It has an eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive. Even though Saturn is almost as big as Jupiter, 
                        Saturn has less than a third the mass of Jupiter. Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU (1,434 million km), with an orbital period of 29.45 years.<BR><BR>

                        Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and 
                        liquid helium, and an outer layer of gas. Saturn has a pale yellow hue, due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current in the metallic 
                        hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth because 
                        of Saturn's greater size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is about a twentieth that of Jupiter. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, 
                        although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 kilometres per hour (1,100 miles per hour).<BR><BR>
                        
                        The planet has a bright and extensive system of rings, composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 146 moons 
                        orbit the planet, of which 63 are officially named; these do not include the hundreds of moonlets in the rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second 
                        largest in the Solar System, is larger (and less massive) than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar System that has a substantial atmosphere.

                        The observation and exploration of Saturn can be divided into three phases: <BR>
                        (1) Pre-modern observations with the naked eye.<BR>
                        (2) Telescopic observations from Earth beginning in the 17th century. <BR>
                        (3) Visitation by space probes, in orbit or on flyby. In the 21st century, telescopic observations continue from Earth 
                        (including Earth-orbiting observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope) and, until its 2017 retirement, from the Cassini orbiter around Saturn.<BR><BR>

                        Saturn has been known since prehistoric times, and in early recorded history it was a major character in various mythologies. Babylonian astronomers 
                        systematically observed and recorded the movements of Saturn. In ancient Greek, the planet was known as Φαίνων Phainon, and in Roman times it was known 
                        as the "star of Saturn". In ancient Roman mythology, the planet Phainon was sacred to this agricultural god, from which the planet takes its modern name.
                        The Romans considered the god Saturnus the equivalent of the Greek god Cronus; in modern Greek, the planet retains the name Cronus—Κρόνος: Kronos

                        Saturn's rings require at least a 15-mm-diameter telescope to resolve and thus were not known to exist until Christiaan Huygens saw them in 1655 and published
                        about this in 1659. Galileo, with his primitive telescope in 1610, incorrectly thought of Saturn's appearing not quite round as two moons on Saturn's sides. 
                        It was not until Huygens used greater telescopic magnification that this notion was refuted, and the rings were truly seen for the first time. Huygens also 
                        discovered Saturn's moon Titan; Giovanni Domenico Cassini later discovered four other moons: Iapetus, Rhea, Tethys, and Dione. In 1675, Cassini discovered the 
                        gap now known as the Cassini Division.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

                        The average distance between Saturn and the Sun is over 1.4 billion kilometers (9 AU). With an average orbital speed of 9.68 km/s,it takes Saturn 10,759 Earth days
                        (or about 29+1⁄2 years) to finish one revolution around the Sun.As a consequence, it forms a near 5:2 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter. The elliptical orbit of Saturn 
                        is inclined 2.48° relative to the orbital plane of the Earth. The perihelion and aphelion distances are, respectively, 9.195 and 9.957 AU, on average.
                        The visible features on Saturn rotate at different rates depending on latitude, and multiple rotation periods have been assigned to various regions (as in Jupiter's case).
                        <BR><BR>
                        Astronomers use three different systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn. System I has a period of 10<SUP>h</SUP> 14<SUP>m</SUP> 00<SUP>s</SUP> 
                        (844.3°/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone, the South Equatorial Belt, and the North Equatorial Belt. The polar regions are considered to have rotation
                        rates similar to System I. All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding the north and south polar regions, are indicated as System II and have been assigned a 
                        rotation period of 10<SUP>h</SUP> 38<SUP>m</SUP> 25.4<SUP>s</SUP> (810.76°/d). System III refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on radio emissions 
                        from the planet detected by Voyager 1 and Voyager 2,[90] System III has a rotation period of 10h 39m 22.4s (810.8°/d). System III has largely superseded System II.
                        <br><br>
                        <H4>ROTATION</H4>
                        A precise value for the rotation period of the interior remains elusive. While approaching Saturn in 2004, Cassini found that the radio rotation period of Saturn had 
                        increased appreciably, to approximately 10<SUP>h</SUP> 45<SUP>m</SUP> 45<SUP>s</SUP> ± 36<SUP>s</SUP>. An estimate of Saturn's rotation (as an indicated rotation rate for Saturn 
                        as a whole) based on a compilation of various measurements from the Cassini, Voyager, and Pioneer probes is 10<SUP>h</SUP> 32<SUP>m</SUP> 35<SUP>s</SUP> Studies of the
                        planet's C Ring yield a rotation period of 10<SUP>h</SUP> 33<SUP>m</SUP> 38<SUP>s</SUP>+1<SUP>m</SUP>
                        <br><br>
                            
                        In March 2007, it was found that the variation in radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn's
                        moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative 
                        to the rotation of the planet.
                            
                        An apparent oddity for Saturn is that it does not have any known trojan asteroids. These are minor planets that orbit the Sun at the stable Lagrangian points, designated L4 and L5, 
                        located at 60° angles to the planet along its orbit. Trojan asteroids have been discovered for Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. Orbital resonance mechanisms, including secular resonance, 
                        are believed to be the cause of the missing Saturnian trojans.
