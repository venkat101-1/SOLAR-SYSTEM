                        <b>Venus</b> is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet and is the closest in mass and size to its 
                        orbital neighbour Earth. Venus is notable for having the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial planets, composed 
                        mostly of carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover. At the surface it has a mean temperature 
                        of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) and a pressure of 92 times that of Earth's at sea level. These extreme conditions compress 
                        carbon dioxide into a supercritical state close to Venus's surface.<br><br>

                        Internally, Venus has a core, mantle, and crust. Venus lacks an internal dynamo, and its weakly induced magnetosphere 
                        is caused by atmospheric interactions with the solar wind. Internal heat escapes through active volcanism, resulting 
                        in resurfacing instead of plate tectonics. Venus is one of two planets in the Solar System, the other being Mercury, 
                        that have no moons. Conditions perhaps favourable for life on Venus have been identified at its cloud layers. Venus may
                        have had liquid surface water early in its history with a habitable environment, before a runaway greenhouse effect evaporated 
                        any water and turned Venus into its present state.<br><br>

                        The rotation of Venus has been slowed and turned against its orbital direction (retrograde) by the currents and drag of its atmosphere. 
                        It takes 224.7 Earth days for Venus to complete an orbit around the Sun, and a Venusian solar year is just under two Venusian days long. 
                        The orbits of Venus and Earth are the closest between any two Solar System planets, approaching each other in synodic periods of 1.6 years. 
                        Venus and Earth have the lowest difference in gravitational potential of any pair of Solar System planets. This allows Venus to be the most 
                        accessible destination and a useful gravity assist waypoint for interplanetary flights from Earth.<br><br>

                        To the naked eye, Venus appears as a white point of light brighter than any other planet or star (apart from the Sun). The planet's mean apparent magnitude is −4.14 with a standard
                        deviation of 0.31. The brightest magnitude occurs during the crescent phase about one month before or after an inferior conjunction. Venus fades to about magnitude −3 when it is backlit by the Sun.
                        The planet is bright enough to be seen in broad daylight, but is more easily visible when the Sun is low on the horizon or setting. As an inferior planet, it always lies within about 47° of the Sun.
                                <br><br>
                        Venus "overtakes" Earth every 584 days as it orbits the Sun. As it does so, it changes from the "Evening Star", visible after sunset, to the "Morning Star", visible before sunrise. Although Mercury, 
                        the other inferior planet, reaches a maximum elongation of only 28° and is often difficult to discern in twilight, Venus is hard to miss when it is at its brightest. Its greater maximum elongation means 
                        it is visible in dark skies long after sunset. As the brightest point-like object in the sky, Venus is a commonly misreported "unidentified flying object".<BR><br><br>

                        Venus is in Earth's sky bright enough to be visible without aid, making it one of the classical planets that human cultures have known and identified throughout history, particularly for being the third 
                        brightest object in Earth's sky after the Sun and the Moon. Because the movements of Venus appear to be discontinuous (it disappears due to its proximity to the sun, for many days at a time, and then 
                        reappears on the other horizon), some cultures did not recognize Venus as a single entity; instead, they assumed it to be two separate stars on each horizon: the morning and evening star    <br><br>
                        
                        The ancient Greeks initially believed Venus to be two separate stars: Phosphorus, the morning star, and Hesperus, the evening star. Pliny the Elder credited the realization that they were a single object 
                        to Pythagoras in the sixth century BC, while Diogenes Laërtius argued that Parmenides (early fifth century) was probably responsible for this discovery. Though they recognized Venus as a single object, 
                        the ancient Romans continued to designate the morning aspect of Venus as Lucifer, literally "Light-Bringer", and the evening aspect as Vesper, both of which are literal translations of their traditional Greek names.

                        Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 0.72 AU (108 million km; 67 million mi), and completes an orbit every 224.7 days. Although all planetary 
                        orbits are elliptical, Venus's orbit is currently the closest to circular, with an eccentricity of less than 0.01.Simulations of the early solar system 
                        orbital dynamics have shown that the eccentricity of the Venus orbit may have been substantially larger in the past, reaching values as high as 0.31 and 
                        possibly impacting early climate evolution

                        All planets in the Solar System orbit the Sun in an anticlockwise direction as viewed from above Earth's north pole. Most planets rotate on their axes in an 
                        anticlockwise direction, but Venus rotates clockwise in retrograde rotation once every 243 Earth days—the slowest rotation of any planet. This Venusian sidereal 
                        day lasts therefore longer than a Venusian year (243 versus 224.7 Earth days). Slowed by its strong atmospheric current the length of the day also fluctuates by up 
                        to 20 minutes. Venus's equator rotates at 6.52 km/h (4.05 mph), whereas Earth's rotates at 1,674.4 km/h (1,040.4 mph).Venus's rotation period measured with Magellan 
                        spacecraft data over a 500-day period is smaller than the rotation period measured during the 16-year period between the Magellan spacecraft and Venus Express visits, 
                        with a difference of about 6.5 minutes. One Venusian year is about 1.92 Venusian solar days.

                        <H4>ROTATION</H4>
                        Venus may have formed from the solar nebula with a different rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary 
                        perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have occurred over the course of billions of years. The rotation period of Venus may represent 
                        an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere.
                        The 584-day average interval between successive close approaches to Earth is almost exactly equal to 5 Venusian solar days (5.001444 to be precise), but the hypothesis of a spin-orbit 
                        resonance with Earth has been discounted

                        The orbital space of Venus has a dust ring-cloud,with a suspected origin either from Venus–trailing asteroids, interplanetary dust migrating in waves, or the remains of the Solar System's 
                        original circumstellar disc that formed the planetary system
